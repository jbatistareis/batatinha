# Batatinha, a Java Chip-8 Emulator
I started this project because it was an interesting idea and looked fun, and it really was.

This program reads a chip-8 binary ROM and parses its execution calls like a processor, all 35 codes from original chip-8 are implemented and i plan to implement the remaining SChip codes.

+ The interface is made with JavaFX
+ The CPU speed is changebe from to 500Hz to 1000Hz
+ The 2 screen colors can be changed to any color
+ The speaker tone is generated with a sine wave function, you can even change the note played (currently only to A, B, C, D, E, F and G)
+ You can control with the on screen key board or with the following key map:
```
1 2 3 C -> 1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D -> Q W E R
7 8 9 E -> A S D F
A 0 B F -> Z X C V
```


*It still have some bugs that i pretend to iron out in the short future...*
